 One possible approach is:

For each project, consider including at least two bullet points (but no more than 3 bullet points), where:

The first bullet point tells the reader the goal/purpose of the project.

The second bullet point tells the reader your specific contribution to the project.

If possible, you should include a 3rd bullet point to tell the reader a bit about the results of your project. This doesn't have to be anything complicated, just some metric showing the success of your project.

Also, make sure that:
• Each bullet point starts with a past tense action verb.
• Each bullet point is no longer than ~1.5 lines.
• Do not include more than 1 sentence per bullet point.

:bulb: Obviously, not all projects will have available links, but you should endeavor to include them whenever possible. They can be to the project itself, the project code, the project website, the project in an app store, an online review of the project, a paper or dataset hosted online, etc.
