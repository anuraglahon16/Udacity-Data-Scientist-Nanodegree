First person description of the userâ€™s abilities, including who they work with and how they contribute.
Written with a professional but conversational tone.
Media links to projects and other sites, including GitHub, personal websites, videos, presentations, or written work.
Preferred contact information is filled out.
Include a Skills section in the summary that lists 5 key skills (programming languages, software, etc.) for SEO purposes.

One good idea is to customize the summary according to the company's job posting of the position you want. 
You can read the items of the job posting and 
try to address as many as you can in the summary (and you can change your summary if you decide to apply for another posting job).

I can't find your Project Section. Maybe it's not visible to the public? Make sure all your profile is visible to the public to receive as many work opportunities as possible. If you don't have a Project Section, you'll definitely need to create one, 
as it is one of the most important parts of your profile!
