Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations
Content Based Recommendations
Within Collaborative Filtering, there are two main branches:

Model Based Collaborative Filtering

In this lesson, you will implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering.
In the next lesson, you will implement Model Based Collaborative Filtering.

Similarity Metrics
In order to implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering, you will learn about some common ways to measure
the similarity between two users (or two items) including:

Pearson's correlation coefficient
Spearman's correlation coefficient
Kendall's Tau
Euclidean Distance
Manhattan Distance
You will learn why sometimes one metric works better than another by looking at a specific situation where 
one metric provides more information than another.

Business Cases For Recommendations
Finally, you will look at the four ideas needed for businesses to implement successful recommendations to drive revenue,
which include:

Relevance
