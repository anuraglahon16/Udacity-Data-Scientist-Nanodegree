Recap
Types of Recommendations
In this lesson, you worked with the MovieTweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:

Knowledge Based Recommendations
Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations
Content Based Recommendations
Within Collaborative Filtering, there are two main branches:

Model Based Collaborative Filtering
Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering
In this lesson, you implemented Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering. In the next lesson, you will implement Model Based Collaborative Filtering.

Similarity Metrics
In order to implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering, you were introduced to and applied a few techniques to assess how similar or distant two users were from one another:

Pearson's correlation coefficient
Spearman's correlation coefficient
Kendall's Tau
Euclidean Distance
Manhattan Distance
Types of Ratings
We took a quick look at different types of ratings:

Did the user interact with an item or not.
Did the user like an item or not.
More granular scales 1-7, 1-10, etc.
It is important to understand what the data might be used for, and what type of granularity might be important for a particular case. One of the main considerations is whether you want to have neutrality available, in which case an odd number of possible values in your scale will provide a value in the middle. Another common question is, how many levels do you really need to understand how much a user likes a particular product? Again, this is largely up to individual preference and specific use cases.

Business Cases For Recommendations
Finally, you looked at the four ideas needed for businesses to implement successful recommendations to drive revenue, which include:

Relevance
Novelty
Serendipity
Increased Diversity
At the end of this lesson, you will have gained a ton of skills to build upon or to start creating your own recommendations in practice.
