Text Data
Text data can come in different forms. A text file (.txt), for example, will contain only text.
As another example, a data set might contain text for one or more variables.
In the world bank projects data set, the regionname, countryname, theme and sector variables contain text.

Analyzing text is a big topic that is covered in other Udacity courses on Natural Language Processing.
For the purposes of this lesson on ETL pipelines, pandas is automatically "extracting" text data when reading in a csv, xml or json file.

Text data will be more important in the Transform stage of an ETL pipeline, which comes later in the lesson.
