Why Do We Need to Process Text?

Extracting plain text: Textual data can come from a wide variety of sources: the web, PDFs, word documents, speech recognition systems, book scans, etc. Your goal is to extract plain text that is 
free of any source specific markup or constructs that are not relevant to your task.

Reducing complexity: Some features of our language like capitalization, punctuation, and common words such 
as a, of, and the, often help provide structure, but don't add much meaning. Sometimes it's best to remove them
if that helps reduce the complexity of the procedures you want to apply later.

You'll prepare text data from different sources with the following text processing steps:

Cleaning to remove irrelevant items, such as HTML tags
Normalizing by converting to all lowercase and removing punctuation
Splitting text into words or tokens
Removing words that are too common, also known as stop words
Identifying different parts of speech and named entities
Converting words into their dictionary forms, using stemming and lemmatization
After performing these steps, your text will capture the essence of what was being conveyed in a form that is easier to work with.
