Modeling

The final stage of the NLP pipeline is modeling, which includes designing a statistical or machine learning model,
fitting its parameters to training data, using an optimization procedure, and then using it to make predictions about unseen data.

The nice thing about working with numerical features 
is that it allows you to choose from all machine learning models or even a combination of them.

Once you have a working model, you can deploy it as a web app, mobile app, or integrate it with other products and services.
The possibilities are endless!
