Singular Value Decomposition Takeaways
Three main takeaways from the previous notebook:

The latent factors retrieved from SVD aren't actually labeled.
We can get an idea of how many latent factors we might want to keep by using the Sigma matrix.
SVD in NumPy will not work when our matrix has missing values. This makes this technique less than useful for our current user-movie matrix.
