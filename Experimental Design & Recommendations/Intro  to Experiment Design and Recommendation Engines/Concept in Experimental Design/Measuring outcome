Measuring Outcomes
The goals of your study may not be the same as the way you evaluate the study's success. Perhaps this is because the goal is something that can't be measured directly. Let's say that you have an idea of a website addition that improves user satisfaction. How should we measure this? In order to evaluate whether or not this improvement has happened, you need to have a way to objectively measure the effect of the addition. For example, you might include a survey to random users to have them rate their website experience on a 1-10 scale. If the addition is helpful, then we should expect the average rating to be higher for those users who are given the addition, versus those who are not. The rating scale acts as a concrete way of measuring user satisfaction. These objective features by which you evaluate performance are known as evaluation metrics.

As a rule of thumb, it's a good idea to consider the goals of a study separate from the evaluation metrics. This provides a couple of useful benefits. First, this makes it clear that the metric isn't the main point of a study: it's the implications of the metric relative to the goal that matters. This is especially important if a metric isn't directly attached to the goal. For example, measuring students' confidence going into a standardized test might be a proxy for the goal of test preparedness, in the absence of being able to get their test scores directly or in a timely fashion.

Secondly, having the metric separate from the goal can clarify the purpose of conducting the study or experiment. It makes sure we can answer the question of why we want to run a study or experiment. From the above example, we aren't measuring confidence just to make people feel good about themselves: we're doing it to try and improve their actual performances.
