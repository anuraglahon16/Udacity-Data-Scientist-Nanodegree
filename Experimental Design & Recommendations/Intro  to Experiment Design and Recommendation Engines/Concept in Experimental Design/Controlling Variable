Controlling Variables
If we want to determine causality between two features, there are two main things to control. First of all, we need to enact the manipulation on one of the features of interest, so that we know that it is causing the change in the other feature. In order to know that it was our manipulated variable and not any other, the second major control point is that we want to make sure that all other features are accounted for. These two requirements make the arguments for causality much stronger with an experiment compared to a quasi-experiment or observational study.

If we aren't able to control all features or there is a lack of equivalence between groups, then we may be susceptible to confounding variables. The correlation observed between two variables might be due to changes in a third variable, rather than one causing the other. Another possibility is that there is a causal relationship between the two features, but it is an indirect relationship mediated by a third, intermediate variable. This intermediate variable might be a larger driver of the changes in the output, with the manipulated variable only having a direct effect on the intermediate feature.

For the case where we see a relationship but don't perform a manipulation, we also need to be careful about the direction of effect. A relationship between variables "A" and "B" might be due to "A" having an effect on "B" or the reverse, "B" having an effect on "A". It might even be the case that "A" and "B" are related through some other function like a third variable.
