Checking Validity
When designing an experiment, it's important to keep in mind validity, which concerns how well conclusions can be supported. There are three major conceptual dimensions upon which validity can be assessed:

Construct Validity
Internal Validity
External Validity
Construct Validity
Construct validity is tied to the earlier discussion of how well one's goals are aligned to the evaluation metrics used to evaluate it. Poor construct validity can come about when an evaluation metric does not actually measure something related to the desired outcome concept. Alternatively, it might be that a metric is ill-constructed, such that it does not make clear distinctions on the outcome concept.

Internal Validity
Internal validity refers to the degree to which a causal relationship can be derived from an experiment's results. Controlling for and accounting for other variables is key to maintaining good internal validity. The previous page on controlling variables shows ways in which internal validity might not be met.

External Validity
External validity is concerned with the ability of an experimental outcome to be generalized to a broader population. This is most relevant with experiments that involve sampling: how representative is the sample to the whole? For studies at academic institutions, a frequent question is if data collected using only college students can be generalized to other age or socioeconomic groups.

Future Content
The text below the video will summarize and provide additional examples of the different facets of validity in an experiment: construct validity, internal validity, and external validity.

At the end of the page, there will be a matching quiz, asking students to link types of validity to descriptions of various violations of validity.
