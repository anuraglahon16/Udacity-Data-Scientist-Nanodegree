PyPi vs. Test PyPi
Note that pypi.org and test.pypy.org are two different websites. 
You'll need to register separately at each website. 
If you only register at pypi.org, you will not be able to upload to the test.pypy.org repository.


cd binomial_package_files
python setup.py sdist
pip install twine

# commands to upload to the pypi test repository
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ dsnd-probability

# command to upload to the pypi repository
twine upload dist/*
pip install dsnd-probability
