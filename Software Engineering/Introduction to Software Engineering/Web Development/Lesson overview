How to Think about This Lesson
The lesson first gives an overview of the three base languages for web development: html, css, and JavaScript.
You could take an entire course just on each of these languages. The goal is for you to get comfortable writing at least some code in each
language so that you understand the web template files at the end of the lesson. This lesson goes through a lot
of information to get you up to speed.

To work with the web template and make a data dashboard, you will only need to write Python code. 
If you want to customize the dashboard, you can do so with just a few changes to the html code. 
But the underlying technologies of data dashboard will be css, html, JavaScript, and Python.
