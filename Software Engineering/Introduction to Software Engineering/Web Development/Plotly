Chart Libraries
There are many web chart libraries out there for all types of use cases. When choosing a library, 
you should consider checking whether or not the library is still being actively developed.

d3.js is one of the most popular (and complex!) javascript data visualization libraries. 
This library is still actively being developed, which you can tell because the latest commit to the d3 GitHub repository is fairly recent.

Other options include chart.js, Google Charts, and nvd3.js, which is built on top of d3.js

Why Plotly
For this lesson, we've chosen plotly for a specific reason: Plotly, although a private company, provides open source libraries 
for both JavaScript and Python.

Because the web app you're developing will have a Python back-end, you can use the Python library to create your charts. 
Rather than having you learn more JavaScript syntax, you can use the Python syntax that you already know. 
However, you haven't built a back-end yet, so for now, you'll see the basics of how Plotly works using the JavaScript library. 
The syntax between the Python and Javascript versions is similar.
