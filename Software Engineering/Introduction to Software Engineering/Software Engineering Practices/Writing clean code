Writing Clean Code: Meaningful Names
Tip: Use meaningful names
Be descriptive and imply type - E.g. for booleans, you can prefix with is_ or has_ to make it clear it is a condition. 
You can also use part of speech to imply types, like verbs for functions and nouns for variables.
Be consistent but clearly differentiate - E.g. age_list and age is easier to differentiate than ages and age.
Avoid abbreviations and especially single letters - (Exception: counters and common math variables) 
Choosing when these exceptions can be made can be determined based on the audience for your code. 
If you work with other data scientists, certain variables may be common knowledge. While if you work with full stack engineers,
it might be necessary to provide more descriptive names in these cases as well.
Long names != descriptive names - You should be descriptive, but only with relevant information.
E.g. good functions names describe what they do well without including details about implementation or highly specific uses.
