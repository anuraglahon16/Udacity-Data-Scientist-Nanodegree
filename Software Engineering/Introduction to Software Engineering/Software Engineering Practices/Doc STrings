Docstrings
Docstring, or documentation strings, are valuable pieces of documentation that explain the functionality of any function or
module in your code. Ideally, each of your functions should always have a docstring.

Docstrings are surrounded by triple quotes. The first line of the docstring is a brief explanation of the function's purpose.
