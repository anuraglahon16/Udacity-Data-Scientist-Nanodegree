Though dropping rows and/or columns holding missing values is quite easy to do using numpy and pandas, it is often not appropriate.

Understanding why the data is missing is important before dropping these rows and columns. 
In this video you saw a number of situations in which dropping values was not a good idea. These included

Dropping data values associated with the effort or time an individual put into a survey.
Dropping data values associated with sensitive information.
In either of these cases, the missing values hold information. 
A quick removal of the rows or columns associated with these missing values would remove missing data that could be used to better inform models.

Instead of removing these values,
we might keep track of the missing values using indicator values, or counts associated with how many questions an individual skipped.
