When looking at the first two questions:

How to break into the field?
What are the placement and salaries for those who attended a coding bootcamp?
we did not need to do any predictive modeling. We only used descriptive and a little inferential statistics to retrieve the results.

Therefore, all steps of CRISP-DM were not necessary for these first two questions. The process would look closer to the following:

1. Business Understanding

2. Data Understanding

3. Prepare Data

4. Evaluate the Results

5. Deploy

However, for the last two questions:

How well can we predict an individual's salary? What aspects correlate well to salary?

How well can we predict an individual's job satisfaction? What aspects correlate well to job satisfaction?

We will need to use a predictive model. We will need to pick up at step 3 to answer these two questions, 
so let's get started. The process for answering these last two questions will follow the full 6 steps shown here.

1. Business Understanding

2. Data Understanding

3. Prepare Data

4. Model Data

5. Evaluate the Results

6. Deploy
