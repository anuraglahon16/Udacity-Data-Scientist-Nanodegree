##Check all of the things you should check about your dataset when getting started.

1.Check each column is a variable, and each row is an individual.

2.Look at the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

3.Check if there are missing values in any of the rows or columns.

4.Check if any columns are of different data types than you would expect (ex: numbers showing as strings)

5.Build exploratory plots like bar charts, histograms, and scatterplots to better understand the data.
