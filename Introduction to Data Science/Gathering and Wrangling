The CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining)
We have now defined the questions we want to answer and had a look through the data available to find the answers, that is, we have looked at the first two steps here:

1. Business Understanding

2. Data Understanding

We can now look at the third step of the process:

3. Prepare Data

Luckily stackoverflow has already collected the data for us. 
However, we still need to wrangle the data in a way for us to answer our questions.
The wrangling and cleaning process is said to take 80% of the time of the data analysis process.
We will see that will hold true through this lesson, 
as a majority of the remaining parts of this lesson will be around basic data wrangling strategies.
